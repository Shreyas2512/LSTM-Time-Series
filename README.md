# LSTM-for-Time-Series-Analysis

This was a part of Smart India Hackathon, 2018.
The dataset consists of readings of Insertion Loss of Optical Fibre Cables over time. It is a Time Series Data . When the insertion loss increases above a threshold value , the cable fails . LSTM is used to predict the approximate time of when this will happen so that the cable is repaired before it fails and hence downtime of the network is reduced .
